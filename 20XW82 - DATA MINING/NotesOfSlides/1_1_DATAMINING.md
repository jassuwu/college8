# DATA MINING

## Types of Data

### Categorical Data

- Represents labels or characteristics, not quantitative.
- **Nominal**: Can be in any order.
  - _Example_: Colors (Red, Blue, Green). There is no specific order in which these should be arranged.
- **Ordinal**: The order matters.
  - _Example_: Ratings (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent). Here, the order in which these labels are arranged matters.

### Numerical Data

- **Discrete**: Countable data.
  - _Example_: The number of students in a class. We can count the students.
- **Continuous**: Measurable data, cannot be counted.
  - **Interval**: No absolute zero.
    - _Example_: Temperature in Celsius. Because there's no absolute zero, we can't say that 20°C is twice as hot as 10°C.
  - **Ratio**: Has an absolute zero.
    - _Example_: Height of a person. It has an absolute zero (i.e., height cannot be negative), and we can say that a person 180cm tall is twice as tall as a person 90cm tall.

## What Data Represents

### Data is More Than Numbers

- Data is a snapshot of the world, much like a photograph.
- A single data point can have a who, what, when, where, and why attached to it.
- Data is a simplification—an abstraction—of the real world.

### Visualization

- Visualization is an abstraction of data.
- The connection between data and what it represents is the key to visualization.
- Computers can turn numbers into shapes & colors, but we must make the connection between data and real life.

### Big Data

- It's hard to see the connection in BIG data, but it’s more obvious when you look at data for an individual.
- Just like what it represents, data can be complex with variability and uncertainty.

### Variability

- With data, you can find patterns, trends, and cycles, but it’s not always a smooth path from point A to point B.
- Consider the fluctuations in the data.

### Uncertainty

- A lot of data is estimated rather than absolute counts.
- An analyst considers a sample, and makes an educated guess about a full population.
- Even a small margin of error can make a big difference.

### Context

- Change your perspective on a dataset, it can help you decide what they represent and how to interpret them.
- Without context, data & data visualization is useless.
- You have to know who collected the data, for whom, how, what your data is about, when, where, and why the data was collected.
- Context can help you add a dimension—a layer of information—to your data graphics.
