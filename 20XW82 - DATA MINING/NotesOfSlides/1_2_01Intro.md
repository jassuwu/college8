## Why Data Mining?

- **Explosive Growth of Data**: Data has grown from terabytes to petabytes due to automated data collection tools, database systems, the Web, and a computerized society.
- **Major Sources of Abundant Data**: Business (Web, e-commerce, transactions, stocks), Science (Remote sensing, bioinformatics, scientific simulation), and Society (news, digital cameras, YouTube).
- **Need for Knowledge**: We are drowning in _data_, but starving for _knowledge_. Hence, the necessity for data mining - automated analysis of massive data sets.

## Evolution of Sciences

1. **Before 1600**: Empirical science
2. **1600-1950s**: Theoretical science. Each discipline grew a theoretical component. Theoretical models often motivate experiments and generalize our understanding.
3. **1950s-1990s**: Computational science. Most disciplines grew a third, computational branch. Computational Science traditionally meant simulation.
4. **1990-now**: Data science. The flood of data from new scientific instruments and simulations, the ability to economically store and manage petabytes of data online, and the Internet and computing Grid that makes all these archives universally accessible have led to the rise of data science.

## Evolution of Database Technology

1. **1960s**: Data collection, database creation, IMS and network DBMS
2. **1970s**: Relational data model, relational DBMS implementation
3. **1980s**: RDBMS, advanced data models (extended-relational, OO, deductive, etc.), application-oriented DBMS (spatial, scientific, engineering, etc.)
4. **1990s**: Data mining, data warehousing, multimedia databases, and Web databases
5. **2000s**: Stream data management and mining, data mining and its applications, Web technology (XML, data integration) and global information systems

## What is Data Mining?

- **Data Mining**: Extraction of interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from a huge amount of data.
- **Alternative Names**: Knowledge discovery (mining) in databases (KDD), knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archeology, data dredging, information harvesting, business intelligence, etc.
- **Note**: Not everything is "data mining". Simple search and query processing, as well as (deductive) expert systems, are not considered data mining.

## Knowledge Discovery (KDD) Process

- **Input Data**: The raw data to be processed.
- **Data Pre-Processing**: Includes data integration, normalization, feature selection, and dimension reduction.
- **Pattern Discovery**: Includes association & correlation, classification, clustering, outlier analysis, etc.
- **Post-Processing**: Includes pattern evaluation, pattern selection, pattern interpretation, and pattern visualization.

This is a view from typical machine learning and statistics communities.

## Example: Medical Data Mining

- **Health Care & Medical Data Mining**: Often adopts such a view in statistics and machine learning.
- **Preprocessing of the Data**: Includes feature extraction and dimension reduction.
- **Classification or/and Clustering Processes**: The main data mining processes.
- **Post-processing for Presentation**: The final step to present the data mining results.

## Multi-Dimensional View of Data Mining

### Data to be Mined
