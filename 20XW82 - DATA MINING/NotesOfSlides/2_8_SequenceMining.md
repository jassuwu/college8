# Complex Types of Data

- Sequence Data (Time-Series).
- Graphs and Network Mining (Homogeneous or Heterogeneous types).
- Other Kinds of Data (Spatial, Spatiotemporal, Web, Text, Streams, ...)

# Mining Sequence Data: An Overview

Sequence data mining is a crucial aspect of data analysis, involving the extraction of meaningful patterns and information from sequential data. This process can be applied to various types of sequence data, including time-series data, symbolic sequences, and biological sequences.

### Time-Series Data

Time-series data consists of long sequences of numeric data, recorded at equal time intervals (e.g., per minute, per hour, or per day). This type of data can be generated by a wide range of natural and economic processes, such as stock market fluctuations, scientific observations, medical records, and natural phenomena.

### Symbolic Sequence Data

Symbolic sequence data comprises long sequences of event or nominal data, which typically are not observed at equal time intervals. Examples include customer shopping sequences, web click streams, and sequences of events in various fields such as science, engineering, and social developments. In this context, gaps between events are usually not significant.

### Biological Sequences

Biological sequences, including DNA and protein sequences, are typically very long and carry important, complex, but hidden semantic meanings. In the case of biological sequences, gaps (representing insertions or deletions in the sequence) are usually significant and can provide crucial insights into the structure and function of the biological entity.

# Similarity Search in Time-Series Data

Time-series data is a sequence of numerical values, where each value corresponds to a particular point in time. Analyzing time-series data involves looking for patterns, trends, and other meaningful information. Here are some key aspects to consider when conducting a similarity search in time-series data:

1. **Trend or Long-Term Movements**: These represent the overall direction in which the data is moving over time. For instance, you might use methods such as the weighted moving average or the least squares to identify trend curves.

2. **Cyclic Movements**: These are oscillations that occur around a trend line or curve over a long period. They represent repeated but non-periodic fluctuations in the data.

3. **Seasonal Variations**: These are patterns that recur at regular intervals, such as annually, quarterly, monthly, etc. An example could be the increase in retail sales during the holiday season each year. To effectively analyze trends, the data often needs to be "deseasonalized" based on a seasonal index computed by autocorrelation.

4. **Random Movements**: These are unpredictable fluctuations that do not follow a discernible pattern or trend. They can be caused by unforeseen events such as labor disputes or changes within a company.

By understanding these aspects, you can more effectively analyze time-series data and find meaningful patterns and trends.

# Time series components

Time series data can be broken into these four components:

1. Secular trend
2. Seasonal variation
3. Cyclical variation
4. Irregular variation

## 1. Secular Trend

The secular trend refers to the long-term upward or downward movement of a time series. In economic terms, "long-term" usually means more than 10 years. This trend describes the historical trajectory of the time series and is used to make future predictions. When the effect of a secular trend is isolated, changes due to other causes become more apparent.

## 2. Seasonal Variation

Seasonal variation in a time series is a pattern of change that recurs regularly over time. These variations are usually due to seasonal differences and festive occasions such as Easter and Christmas. Examples include increased sales of air conditioners in summer, heaters in winter, flu cases in winter, and airline tickets during school vacations.

## 3. Cyclical Variation

Cyclical variations also exhibit recurring patterns but with a longer and more erratic timescale compared to seasonal variations. These cycles can be far from regular, and it is usually impossible to predict the duration of expansion or contraction periods. There is no guarantee of a regularly returning pattern. Examples include floods, wars, changes in interest rates, economic depressions or recessions, and changes in consumer spending.

## 4. Irregular Variation

Irregular (or random) variation in a time series occurs over varying (usually short) periods. It follows no pattern and is inherently unpredictable. It usually occurs randomly and may be linked to events that also occur randomly. Irregular variation cannot be explained mathematically. If the variation cannot be accounted for by secular trend, season, or cyclical variation, then it is usually attributed to irregular variation. Examples include sudden changes in interest rates, collapse of companies, natural disasters, sudden shifts in government policy, dramatic changes to the stock market, and the effect of Middle East unrest on petrol prices.
