# Complex Types of Data

- Sequence Data (Time-Series).
- Graphs and Network Mining (Homogeneous or Heterogeneous types).
- Other Kinds of Data (Spatial, Spatiotemporal, Web, Text, Streams, ...)

# Mining Sequence Data: An Overview

Sequence data mining is a crucial aspect of data analysis, involving the extraction of meaningful patterns and information from sequential data. This process can be applied to various types of sequence data, including time-series data, symbolic sequences, and biological sequences.

### Time-Series Data

Time-series data consists of long sequences of numeric data, recorded at equal time intervals (e.g., per minute, per hour, or per day). This type of data can be generated by a wide range of natural and economic processes, such as stock market fluctuations, scientific observations, medical records, and natural phenomena.

### Symbolic Sequence Data

Symbolic sequence data comprises long sequences of event or nominal data, which typically are not observed at equal time intervals. Examples include customer shopping sequences, web click streams, and sequences of events in various fields such as science, engineering, and social developments. In this context, gaps between events are usually not significant.

### Biological Sequences

Biological sequences, including DNA and protein sequences, are typically very long and carry important, complex, but hidden semantic meanings. In the case of biological sequences, gaps (representing insertions or deletions in the sequence) are usually significant and can provide crucial insights into the structure and function of the biological entity.
