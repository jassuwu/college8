       "['THE ALLIES AFTER NASSAU IN DECEMBER 1960, THE U.S . FIRST\\n\\nPROPOSED TO HELP NATO DEVELOP ITS OWN NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE . BUT EUROPE\\n\\nMADE NO ATTEMPT TO DEVISE A PLAN . LAST WEEK, AS THEY STUDIED THE\\n\\nNASSAU ACCORD BETWEEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN,\\n\\nEUROPEANS SAW EMERGING THE FIRST OUTLINES OF THE NUCLEAR NATO THAT THE\\n\\nU.S . WANTS AND WILL SUPPORT . IT ALL SPRANG FROM THE ANGLO-U.S .\\n\\nCRISIS OVER CANCELLATION OF THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLT MISSILE, AND THE\\n\\nU.S . OFFER TO SUPPLY BRITAIN AND FRANCE WITH THE PROVED POLARIS (TIME,\\n\\nDEC . 28) . THE ONE ALLIED LEADER WHO UNRESERVEDLY WELCOMED THE POLARIS\\n\\nOFFER WAS HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO BY THUS KEEPING A SEPARATE NUCLEAR\\n\\nDETERRENT FOR BRITAIN HAD SAVED HIS OWN NECK . BACK FROM NASSAU, THE\\n\\nPRIME MINISTER BEAMED THAT BRITAIN NOW HAD A WEAPON THAT \" WILL LAST A\\n\\nGENERATION . THE TERMS ARE VERY GOOD . \" MANY OTHER BRITONS WERE NOT SO\\n\\nSURE . THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHOULDER NONE OF THE $800 MILLION\\n\\nDEVELOPMENT COST OF POLARIS, IT HAS ALREADY POURED $28 MILLION INTO\\n\\nSKYBOLT AND WILL HAVE TO SPEND PERHAPS $1 BILLION MORE FOR A FLEET OF\\n\\nMISSILE-PACKING SUBMARINES . AT BEST, THE BRITISH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO\\n\\nDESIGN, BUILD AND PROVE ITS NUCLEAR FLEET BEFORE 1970, THREE YEARS\\n\\nAFTER BRITAIN\\'S BOMBER FORCE HAS PRESUMABLY BECOME OBSOLETE . THEN WHAT\\n\\n? TORY BACKBENCHERS ARE LOUDLY SKEPTICAL OF WHAT THEY CALL \" THE\\n\\nSMALL TYPE \" IN THE NASSAU PACT, WHICH STIPULATES THAT BRITAIN\\'S\\n\\nPOLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, EXCEPT WHEN \" SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS \"\\n\\nINTERVENE, MUST BE COMMITTED TO A TRULY MULTILATERAL NATO FORCE . DOES\\n\\nTHAT MEAN THAT BRITAIN WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE NO STRIKE FORCE OF ITS OWN\\n\\n? WHO WILL DECIDE WHEN OR WHETHER NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFY\\n\\nWITHDRAWAL OF SUBMARINES FROM NATO, PARTICULARLY IF THOSE NATIONAL\\n\\nINTERESTS CONFLICT WITH U.S . POLICY ? THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL IS\\n\\nWHETHER FRANCE\\'S INCLUSION IN THE OFFER WAS A DELIBERATE PLOY BY JACK\\n\\nKENNEDY TO END OR AT LEAST DOWNGRADE BRITAIN\\'S PRIZED \" SPECIAL\\n\\nRELATIONSHIP \" WITH THE U.S . THE CARTOONISTS WENT EVEN FARTHER . THEY\\n\\nNOT ONLY SHOWED SUPERMAC JUMPING TO SUPERJACK\\'S COMMANDS, BUT DE GAULLE\\n\\nAND ADENAUER AS WELL . AS EDITH SAID . THE FRENCH, WHO GOT NO HELP FROM\\n\\nTHE U.S . IN DEVELOPING THEIR FORCE DE FRAPPE, WERE QUICK TO CROW THAT\\n\\nBRITAIN\\'S VAUNTED TIES WITH THE U.S . HAD BROUGHT IT NOTHING BUT\\n\\nHUMILIATION . BY CONTRAST, BRAGGED FRENCH OFFICIALS, THE SKYBOLT FIASCO\\n\\nONLY VINDICATED FRANCE\\'S DECISION TO DEVELOP ITS OWN BOMBS AND DELIVERY\\n\\nSYSTEMS . THUS, THOUGH CHARLES DE GAULLE PROMISED TO \" REFLECT \" ON THE\\n\\nPOLARIS OFFER, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ANY\\n\\nOFFER THAT WOULD SUBJECT A FRENCH FORCE TO ALLIED CONTROL . IT IS DE\\n\\nGAULLE\\'S UNSWERVING CONVICTION THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY TO\\n\\nINVADE WESTERN EUROPE, NO NATION THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY ATTACKED MEANING\\n\\nTHE U.S . WOULD INVITE NUCLEAR DEVASTATION BY HELPING ITS ALLIES . THUS\\n\\nUNLIKE BRITAIN\\'S BOMBER FORCE, WHICH ALL ALONG HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO \"\\n\\nTHE WESTERN STRATEGIC DETERRENT, \" FRANCE\\'S FORCE DE FRAPPE WILL BE\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR FRANCE\\'S DEFENSE . AT THE SAME TIME, DE GAULLE HAS\\n\\nLONG ARGUED THAT THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE COULD BE RUN MOST EFFICIENTLY BY\\n\\nA TRIUMVIRATE THAT WOULD INCLUDE FRANCE AS AN EQUAL OF THE U.S . AND\\n\\nBRITAIN . THIS IS ONE OF HIS MAJOR, IF UNSPOKEN, CONDITIONS FOR BRITISH\\n\\nMEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET ; AND DE GAULLE SUGGESTED POINTEDLY TO\\n\\nMACMILLAN THAT IT WOULD HELP IF BRITAIN WERE TO SHARE ITS ADVANCED\\n\\nMISSILE TECHNOLOGY WITH FRANCE . WHEN MACMILLAN REPLIED NONCOMMITTALLY\\n\\nTHAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH KENNEDY, DE GAULLE TOLD HIS\\n\\nGUEST WITH HAUTEUR THAT FRANCE IN THAT CASE COULD DO NOTHING TO EASE\\n\\nBRITAIN\\'S ENTRY INTO EUROPE . GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR . KONRAD ADENAUER,\\n\\nON THE OTHER HAND, IS FEARFUL THAT DE GAULLE WILL SNAP UP THE POLARIS\\n\\nOFFER AND IN THIS WAY ACHIEVE HIS GOAL OF A THREE-NATION NATO\\n\\nDIRECTORATE . THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT VOWED IN 1954 NOT TO MANUFACTURE\\n\\nNUCLEAR WEAPONS, ADENAUER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE THAT\\n\\nWITHOUT THEM, AND WITH NO SAY IN THEIR USE, WEST GERMANY WILL BE\\n\\nRELEGATED TO SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP IN THE ALLIANCE . LAST WEEK AN\\n\\nOFFICIAL BULLETIN EVEN REVIVED THE OLD, BITTER CRY THAT U.S . PLEAS FOR\\n\\nGREATER RELIANCE ON CONVENTIONAL FORCES ARE AIMED AT RAISING GERMAN \"\\n\\nCANNON FODDER \" FOR U.S . \" ATOMIC KNIGHTS . \" A FROSTY LETTER FROM THE\\n\\nCHANCELLOR TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED THAT GERMANY, WHICH ALREADY\\n\\nSUPPLIES ALMOST 50 PER CENT OF NATO GROUND STRENGTH, DOES NOT INTEND TO\\n\\nRAISE ANY MORE DIVISIONS FOR CONVENTIONAL WARFARE . YET U.S . STRATEGIC\\n\\nPLANNERS REASON THAT THE ONLY CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO SOVIET ATTACK IS A\\n\\nSTRONG ARMY ON THE GROUND, BACKED BY THE VAST U.S . NUCLEAR ARSENAL .\\n\\nFACT IS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD NEVER BE USED\\n\\nINDEPENDENTLY OF THE U.S . AGAINST RUSSIA WITHOUT INVITING DEVASTATING\\n\\nSOVIET RETALIATION . AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORTS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH\\n\\nWILL HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE A NUCLEAR CAPACITY THAT REPRESENTS ONLY 4\\n\\nPER CENT OF U.S . NUCLEAR POWER . \" IT IS JUST A DAMNED NUISANCE, \"\\n\\nSAID A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LAST WEEK . \" IT MEANS NOTHING\\n\\nMILITARILY EXCEPT THAT WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO BAIL OUT THE FIRST\\n\\nCOUNTRY THAT THROWS THE FIRST PEA AT THE RUSSIANS OR ANYONE ELSE . \"\\n\\nCHARLES DE GAULLE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO AGREE, AT LEAST UNTIL HIS\\n\\nFORCE DE FRAPPE BECOMES OBSOLETE . FOR BRITAIN AND GERMANY, THE\\n\\nMULTILATERAL DETERRENT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE . EVENTUALLY, FRANCE, TOO,\\n\\nMAY WELL FIND A NATO-CONTROLLED POLARIS FLEET, OR ITS POSSIBLE\\n\\nSUCCESSOR, A EUROPEAN MINUTEMAN ARSENAL, THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE\\n\\nSPIRALING COST AND DIMINISHING VALUE OF GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR .',\n",

THE ODDS WERE\\n\\nAGAINST HIM, FOR WEIDNER, 40, WAS A CRIPPLE ON CRUTCHES WHO LIVED IN\\n\\nTHE VILLAGE OF NEUGERSDORF, 115 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FRONTIER OF\\n\\nFREEDOM BUT HANS WEIDNER DID HAVE ONE MAJOR ASSET, THE BUS THAT\\n\\nHE OPERATED FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNIST REGIME . IT WAS AN UGLY THING, AND\\n\\nANCIENT . ITS CHASSIS CREAKED, AND THE ENGINE COUGHED ; A\\n\\nCREAM-COLORED COAT OF PAINT COULD NOT DISGUISE THE WELTS AND BRUISES OF\\n\\nTWO DECADES OF CHUGGING SERVICE . IN FACT, THE BUS WAS READY FOR THE\\n\\nJUNK PILE WHEN WEIDNER DECIDED TO PRESS IT INTO SERVICE FOR ONE LAST\\n\\nRUN . SHARP BLADES . THE HAZARDS WOULD BE GREAT ON THE JOURNEY TO THE\\n\\nBORDER ; SO WEIDNER SIGNED UP A FELLOW VILLAGER, JURGEN WAGNER, 22, TO\\n\\nTAKE THE WHEEL . EIGHT DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, THE PAIR BEGAN THE\\n\\nFEVERISH PREPARATIONS IN WEIDNER\\'S GARAGE . FIRST WEIDNER AND WAGNER\\n\\nATTACHED A HEAVY SNOWPLOW TO THE FRONT OF THE BUS, NOT TO PLOW SNOW,\\n\\nBUT TO SCOOP AWAY THE HEAVY OBSTACLES THEY KNEW AWAITED THEM AT\\n\\nROADBLOCKS AHEAD . TO ALL SIX LUGS ON EACH FRONT WHEEL THEY BOLTED\\n\\nSHARP BLADES OF THE TOUGHEST STEEL, AFFIXED SO THAT THE WHIRLING EDGES\\n\\nWOULD CHOP BARBED WIRE TO BITS . THEN THEY WEDGED ONE-QUARTER-INCH\\n\\nSECTIONS OF STEEL PLATE INSIDE THE BUS TO STOP BULLETS . AT LAST ALL\\n\\nWAS READY . ON CHRISTMAS EVE, WEIDNER AND WAGNER PILED THEIR WIVES AND\\n\\nFOUR CHILDREN ABOARD, NOT FORGETTING THREE TONS OF HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS\\n\\n. FOR ADDED PROTECTION THE PLOTTERS SHOVELED A TON OF COAL AND POTATOES\\n\\nINTO THE BACK OF THE BUS . THEN THEY CHUGGED OFF NORTH TOWARD BERLIN\\n\\nALONG BACK ROADS TO ESCAPE COMMUNIST PATROLS . JUST BEFORE THEY REACHED\\n\\nTHE WALL, THEY PLANNED TO SWING WEST IN ORDER TO ENTER THE EAST-WEST\\n\\nAUTOBAHN LEADING TO THE U.S . SECTOR OF THE CITY . EN ROUTE, THE\\n\\nRADIATOR FROZE IN THE SUBZERO WEATHER . THAT FIXED, THEY WERE ONLY A\\n\\nFEW MILES FARTHER WHEN A TIRE BLEW OUT . THE KIDS WERE CRYING AND THE\\n\\nWIVES SHIVERING WITH COLD AND PANIC WHEN, AT LAST, THEY ARRIVED AT\\n\\nDREWITZ, THE MOST HEAVILY GUARDED CHECKPOINT ON THE ENTIRE AUTOBAHN TO\\n\\nBERLIN .
