# Time series components

Time series data can be broken into these four components:

1. Secular trend
2. Seasonal variation
3. Cyclical variation
4. Irregular variation

## 1. Secular Trend

The secular trend refers to the long-term upward or downward movement of a time series. In economic terms, "long-term" usually means more than 10 years. This trend describes the historical trajectory of the time series and is used to make future predictions. When the effect of a secular trend is isolated, changes due to other causes become more apparent.

## 2. Seasonal Variation

Seasonal variation in a time series is a pattern of change that recurs regularly over time. These variations are usually due to seasonal differences and festive occasions such as Easter and Christmas. Examples include increased sales of air conditioners in summer, heaters in winter, flu cases in winter, and airline tickets during school vacations.

## 3. Cyclical Variation

Cyclical variations also exhibit recurring patterns but with a longer and more erratic timescale compared to seasonal variations. These cycles can be far from regular, and it is usually impossible to predict the duration of expansion or contraction periods. There is no guarantee of a regularly returning pattern. Examples include floods, wars, changes in interest rates, economic depressions or recessions, and changes in consumer spending.

## 4. Irregular Variation

Irregular (or random) variation in a time series occurs over varying (usually short) periods. It follows no pattern and is inherently unpredictable. It usually occurs randomly and may be linked to events that also occur randomly. Irregular variation cannot be explained mathematically. If the variation cannot be accounted for by secular trend, season, or cyclical variation, then it is usually attributed to irregular variation. Examples include sudden changes in interest rates, collapse of companies, natural disasters, sudden shifts in government policy, dramatic changes to the stock market, and the effect of Middle East unrest on petrol prices.
