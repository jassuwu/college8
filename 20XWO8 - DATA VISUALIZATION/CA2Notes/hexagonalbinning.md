# Hexagonal Binning

## Overview

Hexagonal Binning is a visualization method for data analysis, particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that cause overlap in scatterplots, obscuring trends and clusters.

## Why Hexagonal Binning?

- **Scatterplots** struggle with large datasets due to point overlap.
- **Binning** aggregates data into discrete groups, revealing patterns not visible in scatterplots.
- **Hexagonal Binning** is preferred over square binning due to its efficiency and compact division of 2D data space.

## How It Works

- The XY plane is uniformly tiled with hexagons.
- Data points falling within each hexagon are counted.
- Hexagons are then visualized using a color range or size variation based on the count.

## Advantages

- Hexagons offer a more circle-like shape, leading to efficient data aggregation.
- Adjacent hexagons share edges, not just vertices, allowing for a more cohesive data representation.
- Points within a hexagon are closer to the center compared to squares or triangles of equal area.

## Applications

- **Sparse Scatterplots**: Hexagonal Binning can reveal underlying trends by aggregating data points into hexagons, colored from yellow to dark red based on density.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Hexagons can vary in size to represent additional variables like standard deviation.
- **Choropleth Maps**: Hexagonal bins are increasingly used to represent data on maps, shading areas in proportion to statistical variables.

## Considerations

- Hexagonal Binning is computationally more complex than square binning.
- It's essential to choose appropriate color scales to accurately represent data density and additional variables.

By using Hexagonal Binning, data analysts can overcome the limitations of traditional scatterplots, providing a clearer and more detailed visualization of complex datasets.
